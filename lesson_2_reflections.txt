What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When we initialize a repository, we create a git repository in the current directory and a .git
    folder is added to the current directory. We need to do it to create the directory a git repository
    and keep track of the status of the files in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you
think it offers?

    Staging area has the files which have changes to be commited. It is useful as git add files into
    the staging area and we can commit that particular files.
