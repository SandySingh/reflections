When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When we want others to make changes on our code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-
date with your remote repository?

    Because this is possible that we want some changes on GitHub but not on our local repository like
    when we are experimenting something with others.
