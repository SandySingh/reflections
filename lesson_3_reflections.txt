When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When we want others to make changes on our code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-
date with your remote repository?

    Because this is possible that we want some changes on GitHub but not on our local repository like
    when we are experimenting something with others.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of
another?

    Forks are used when we want to copy a repository on GitHub servers whereas clone is used to copy
    a repository on your own computer. Branches are part of repositories to make different changes such
    that they don't affect the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    Because then we can see the differences between the remote and the changes we made locally on our
    repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be
harder?

    Without using Git or GitHub we have to maintain all the changes in our repository to check them
    again which would be hard. Git would be a lot easier.
